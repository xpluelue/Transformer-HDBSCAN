## Technical Background

### Radar Pulse Deinterleaving Problem

Radar deinterleaving is a critical signal processing task in electronic warfare, surveillance, and radar signal intelligence applications. When multiple radar emitters operate simultaneously within the same electromagnetic environment, their transmitted pulses become interleaved in time, creating complex pulse trains that must be separated and attributed to their originating sources.

The radar pulse deinterleaving problem involves separating radar pulses from multiple unknown emitters present in a single recorded pulse train. This separation task is particularly challenging because:

- The number of active emitters is typically unknown a priori
- Pulse patterns may be irregular or adaptive
- Environmental factors introduce noise and measurement uncertainty
- Real-time processing constraints limit computational complexity


Let $X = \lbrace x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots,x_{n} \rbrace$ represent a pulse train containing n pulses from N unknown emitters. The deinterleaving task seeks to partition $X$ into N disjoint subsets:

$$X = \lbrace U_{1},\dots U_{N} \rbrace$$

where each subset $U_{i}$ contains all pulses originating from emitter i.

### Pulse Descriptor Words (PDWs)

A Pulse Descriptor Word (PDW) is a multi-dimensional feature vector that characterizes the measurable parameters of a radar pulse. PDWs serve as the fundamental input for deinterleaving algorithms, providing quantitative descriptions of pulse characteristics.

The standard PDW parameters used in this challenge include:

#### Time of Arrival (ToA)

- **Definition**: Timestamp when the pulse leading edge is detected
- **Units**: Microseconds ($\mu s$)
- **Significance**: Enables temporal pattern analysis and pulse repetition interval (PRI) estimation

#### Centre Frequency (CF)

- **Definition**: Carrier frequency of the radar pulse
- **Units**: Megahertz (MHz) or Gigahertz (GHz)
- **Significance**: Primary discriminator for frequency-agile or fixed-frequency emitters

#### Pulse Width (PW)

- **Definition**: Duration of the pulse envelope
- **Units**: Microseconds ($\mu s$)
- **Significance**: Indicates radar type and operational mode

#### Angle of Arrival (AoA)

- **Definition**: Spatial direction from which the pulse arrives
- **Units**: Degrees (°) or radians
- **Significance**: Provides spatial discrimination between emitters

#### Amplitude/Power

- **Definition**: Peak or integrated power level of the received pulse
- **Units**: Decibels (dB) or linear scale
- **Significance**: Relates to emitter power and propagation distance

### Deinterleaving Approaches

#### Traditional Methods

- **Histogram-based**: Analyze statistical distributions of PDW parameters (PRI histograms, frequency clustering)
- **Sequence-based**: Exploit temporal ordering and pattern recognition (PRI sequence matching, Markov models)
- **Clustering**: Unsupervised learning approaches (K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering)

#### Modern Deep Learning Approaches

Recent advances leverage transformer architectures for deinterleaving using metric learning approaches:

- **Sequence-to-sequence models**: Process entire pulse trains simultaneously
- **Self-attention mechanisms**: Capture long-range dependencies between pulses
- **Triplet loss training**: Optimizes embedding similarity within emitters and dissimilarity between emitters
- **Synthetic data generation**: Creates controlled training scenarios with known ground truth

Performance is typically evaluated using clustering metrics such as **V-measure** (the primary evaluation metric for this challenge), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), and silhouette coefficients.

### Challenge Context

This challenge is inspired by recent research including "Radar Pulse Deinterleaving with Transformer Based Deep Metric Learning" (arXiv:2503.13476), which demonstrates transformer-based approaches achieving 0.882 adjusted mutual information score on synthetic radar pulse data using 5-dimensional PDWs.

### Transformer metric-learning baseline

The maintained complete-file Transformer + GPU HDBSCAN pipeline lives under
`src/turing_deinterleaving_challenge/transformer_hdbscan/`. Its architecture,
training, evaluation, and PDW Studio export commands are documented in
[`docs/transformer_hdbscan.md`](docs/transformer_hdbscan.md).

The included Transformer baseline uses a four-layer encoder only:

```
raw PDW -> delta-ToA + per-window normalization -> Transformer Encoder
        -> one 8-dimensional embedding per pulse -> HDBSCAN
```

It trains with same-window triplet metric loss: same-emitter pulses are pulled
together and different-emitter pulses are pushed apart.  Emitter labels are
arbitrary between pulse trains, so positives are never formed across different
windows.  Train with fixed windows rather than complete pulse trains because
standard Transformer attention grows quadratically with sequence length:

```commandline
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=2 scripts/train_transformer_metric.py \
  --config configs/transformer_metric_scan.yaml \
  --train-dir /path/to/stare \
  --validation-dir /path/to/stare \
  --n-jobs 8 \
  --device cuda \
  --output results/transformer_metric.pt
```

The script lazily reads HDF5 windows and selects the checkpoint with the best
validation V-measure after per-window HDBSCAN clustering. Each window is
normalized independently after the delta-ToA conversion, so its features use
only the pulses available to the Transformer and HDBSCAN for that score.
Training, validation, and test always visit every non-empty pulse train in
source order. They use non-overlapping 1024-pulse windows; a final partial
window is padded with an attention mask so no trailing pulses are dropped.
There is no sampling mode. Add `--shuffle-train-windows` to shuffle the order
of all training windows each epoch; validation and test windows always retain
source order.
Training caches up to 32 read-only HDF5 handles per DataLoader worker and
keeps workers alive across epochs. Add `--amp` (BF16 by default on compatible
CUDA GPUs) to use automatic mixed precision; select FP16 explicitly with
`--amp-dtype fp16`.
Training retains every non-empty window. For a directly comparable HDBSCAN
metric, validation and test score only complete 1024-pulse windows containing
at least two true emitters (`--min-emitters 2`), exactly as
`evaluate_hdbscan_scan.py` does; skipped tail/single-emitter windows are
reported in the epoch log and test JSON. HDBSCAN is parallelized across the
eligible independent windows. `--n-jobs` is the number of concurrent
clustering workers rather than the number assigned to one small HDBSCAN call.
DDP writes rank-labelled lifecycle messages, epoch summaries, and any fatal
traceback from both ranks to one `train.log` under a directory derived from
the model name by default. Only rank zero records the per-epoch metrics. For example,
`--output results/transformer_metric.pt` writes logs to
`results/transformer_metric/logs/`. Override the location with `--log-dir`.
In DDP, `--n-jobs` is the worker count per GPU process; `baseline.sh` divides
its `N_JOBS` value across the two training processes. `BATCH_SIZE` is global,
so each GPU receives half of it.
V-measure is the challenge's primary metric, so it is also the early-stopping
and best-checkpoint criterion; the default patience is five consecutive epochs.
The supplied experiment YAML uses random seed 42 for both training and test
evaluation.
TSRD layouts using `val_scan` are recognized as validation sets. If a dataset
release genuinely has no separate validation split, omit `--validation-dir`;
the script then holds out 10% of train files for validation and keeps test
files untouched.
For the standard two-GPU run, execute `bash baseline.sh`. Training, validation,
and test evaluation use DDP (one process per GPU): each rank handles a disjoint
half of the windows, rank zero aggregates metrics and displays the sole tqdm
progress bar.

`baseline.sh` follows the V6 baseline convention: add a
`model-or-experiment-name:config.yaml` item to its `EXPERIMENTS` array and all
artifacts are kept under
`experiments/<experiment-name>/`:

```
experiments/transformer_metric_scan/
├── config.yaml
├── model.pt
├── predictions.npz
├── test.json
└── logs/
    └── train.log
```

Test evaluation stores the HDBSCAN assignments in `predictions.npz`. It
contains the original dataset window index, source-file index, pulse start,
predicted labels, and true labels for every eligible full window. HDBSCAN's
noise label is `-1`, and cluster IDs are local to each window. When
`--predictions-output` is omitted, the filename defaults to
`<checkpoint_stem>_predictions.npz` next to the checkpoint.

`configs/transformer_metric_scan.yaml` holds the executable training/evaluation
commands as well as all training, model, and evaluation parameters. Copy it to
define either a Transformer variant or a different model, then add the new
`name:config.yaml` pair to `EXPERIMENTS`; `baseline.sh` itself needs no model
specific changes. Its `BATCH_SIZE` environment variable overrides the YAML
batch size for both training and evaluation, for example
`BATCH_SIZE=512 bash baseline.sh`. Its `N_JOBS` value is the total worker
budget and is split between DDP processes. Use
`RUN_ROOT=experiments/scan_v2 bash baseline.sh` to change the parent directory,
or `ONLY=transformer_metric_scan bash baseline.sh` to select a single item.
Each invocation starts a concise fresh `train.log`; use a new experiment name
when separate historical runs need to be retained.

### Chronological Transformer EEND-EDA

The EEND-EDA experiment keeps the same 1024-pulse windows, delta-ToA
transformation, per-window normalization, and Transformer encoder as the
metric-learning baseline. It replaces HDBSCAN with a chronological LSTM
encoder-decoder attractor head:

```
normalized PDWs -> Transformer embeddings -> chronological EDA
                -> variable attractors -> pulse-attractor softmax -> argmax
```

Training uses only a Hungarian-matched assignment cross entropy and the
attractor-existence binary cross entropy. `max_attractors=96` is a configurable
safety cap, chosen just above TSRD's published maximum of 90 emitters in a
complete scan pulse train. Training decodes only to the largest true emitter
count in the current batch plus one stop step, and inference stops at the first
existence probability below 0.5. Run only this experiment with:

```commandline
ONLY=transformer_eda_scan BATCH_SIZE=128 bash baseline.sh
```

Its test JSON contains the standard clustering metrics plus local emitter-count
accuracy, MAE, under-count rate, and over-count rate.

## Installation
### Interface
The TDC version 1.3 was developed and tested on `python=3.13` but any version  >=3.10 should work. If you face any 
problems with during the installation, please report an issue. 

After creating virtual environment, install the package from source via

```commandline
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-deinterleaving-challenge.git
```

If you want to install the TDC in developer mode, activate your virtual environment and install it by cloning 
the repository and installing it directly via

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-deinterleaving-challenge.git && cd turing-deinterleaving-challenge 
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For running the optional Jupyter notebook demos, install the notebook UI packages:

```commandline
python3 -m pip install ipykernel ipywidgets
```

### Local/server synchronization

Run the maintained synchronization script from the **local workstation**, not
from an SSH shell on the server. Create a local `.sync.env` file first; it is
ignored by both Git and rsync and must never contain an SSH password or
private-key body:

```dotenv
TDC_REMOTE_HOST=your-user@your-server
TDC_REMOTE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/turing-deinterleaving-challenge
```

Preview a code upload first, then run it:

```commandline
scripts/sync_workspace.sh push-code --dry-run
scripts/sync_workspace.sh push-code
```

`push-code` and `pull-code` make the non-generated source tree identical while
protecting datasets, checkpoints, and server-side experiment outputs through
`resync.ignore`. To keep only compact metrics locally, run:

```commandline
scripts/sync_workspace.sh pull-metrics --dry-run
scripts/sync_workspace.sh pull-metrics
```

There is deliberately no committed default server address. Formal tests are
source code and are synchronized; credentials, caches, and generated test
outputs are excluded.

### Data Download
The data is available on HuggingFace and can be downloaded directly here: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/alan-turing-institute/turing-deinterleaving-challenge](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alan-turing-institute/turing-deinterleaving-challenge). 
If you have a HuggingFace token that 
provides larger API request limits, we recommend using it. If not, there might be a timeout when downloading the dataset (it is big). 
If you're running into a timeout or limited API call issue, it resumes when simply running the download again. 
Due to the dataset size, you might need to repeat several times. Alternatively, you can use the API by running

```python
from pathlib import Path
from turing_deinterleaving_challenge import download_dataset
subset_list = ["train", "validation", "test"]
hf_token_path = "path/to/hf/token.txt" # path to huggingface token
with open(hf_token_path, "r") as hf_file:
    hf_token = hf_file.read()  # read in token file

save_dir = Path("../data")
train_set_path = download_dataset(
    save_dir=save_dir,
    subsets=subset_list,
    hf_token=hf_token
)
```

Remember that you might need to run the command several times if you don't have a HuggingFace token before the dataset 
is fully downloaded. You can alternatively set your HuggingFace token as an `env` variable. Our interface will load your 
token automatically. To do so, copy .env.example as .env
```commandline
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, [generate a huggingface token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and place it in the .env.

## Data description
![Schematic simulation overview for dataset creation](figures/summary_schematic_dataset.png)
The dataset is composed of six sub-datasets, train, validation, and test for two receiver modes, each of which contain 
simulated interleaved pulse trains. The dataset represents the emitted ground truth of the ElectroMagnetic Environment (EME), 
rather than specifically modelling realistic receiver models. Therefore, the dataset is independent of an individual 
receiver type, and focuses instead on the superposition of realistic emitters. Note that the dataset is not suited for
specific emitter identification model development, as it does not include hardware-specific noise. However, parameter 
ranges for pulse emissions were gleaned from publicly available sources.

Pulses were realistically simulated using a single static emitter which could either observe the entire frequency 
spectrum at once (_stare_) or which is sweeping through at deterministic intervals (_scan_). _Stare_ mode can be understood
as an oracle receiver that can observe the entire EME (except randomly dropped pulses), whereas _scan_ simulates more realistic
receiver setups.

Emitters were static or mobile on a two-dimensional plane, but can only move along straight lines with constant velocity.
Both datasets (i.e. _scan_ and _stare_) were created using the same transmitter configuration. Received pulses are 
represented as Pulse Descriptor Words (PDWs) to reduce storage and memory consumption. Each PDW 
consists of the Time of Arrival (ToA), Centre Frequency (CF), Pulse Width (PW),
Angle of Arrival (AoA), and Amplitude (more information about PDWs below).

![TSRD simulation](figures/config_2.gif)

Each pulse train is saved as `h5` file which contains the stream of PDWs, arbitrary emitter labels, and pulse train metadata.
You can easily load an access these properties by running

```python
from turing_deinterleaving_challenge import PulseTrain
pt_path = "path/to/pulse/train.h5"

pt = PulseTrain.load(pt_path)
pdw_stream = pt.data
emitter_labels = pt.labels
meta_data = pt.metadata
```

Similar emitter types were used in several simulations but with different configurations to model independent scenarios.
**We stress that emitter labels are arbitrary numbers, and are only consistent with respect to the same pulse train**. 
Consequently, label `1` in the first pulse train file might be a different emitter than the same label `1` in a 
different pulse train. Your model and loss function needs to account for this if you use batching.

- `data/structure.py` defines the `PulseTrain` class, with various methods for saving and loading the data in scripts.
- `models/model.py` defines the Abstract Base Class that your model solution must wrap into.
- `models/evaluate.py` contains functions to evaluate your challenge model on the ground truth emitter labels. `evaluate_labels` in particular computes **V measure**, which is the principal evaluation metric of the challenge.
- `visualisation/visualisations.py` contains useful functions for plotting the PDW data in a structured way.
